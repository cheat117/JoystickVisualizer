Show your stick and throttle movement as an overlay while streaming or recording videos.

### **[Download latest release here](https://github.com/mdjarv/JoystickVisualizer/releases/latest)**

This software will read buttons and axis input from supported devices and visualize them using 3D models on top of a flat colored background making it easy to apply chroma key and placing them as overlays using streaming software like OBS or XSplit

## Setting it up

### Start the Software

* Start `JoystickProxy.exe`, you will see a list of found devices. If your device is in the [Supported Devices](#supported-devices) list but does not show, check the "`Show all devices`" checkbox and contact me so that we can figure out what the issue is.

![Proxy Window](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdjarv/JoystickVisualizer/master/proxy_window.png)

* Start `JoystickVisualizer.exe`, select your resolution and make sure to run in Windowed Mode

Your devices should show up in the Visualizer when you start moving them

### Configure OBS

1. In OBS add a `Window Capture` source, give it a useful name like "Joystick Visualizer"

![Add Window Capture Source](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdjarv/JoystickVisualizer/master/obs_1_add_window_capture.png)

2. Make sure you select `JoystickVisualizer.exe` and you can also uncheck "Capture Cursor"

![Select Inner Window](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdjarv/JoystickVisualizer/master/obs_2_add_window_capture.png)

3. Right click on the Source you just created and select `Filters`

4. By clicking the + in the bottom left, add a `Color Key` filter. Change the `Key Color Type` to `Custom Color`

### Controlling the camera

The camera in the Visualizer can be moved around by right-clicking and dragging, and the view can be zoomed using the mouse wheel.

There are also three camera presets that can be accessed with the `1`, `2` and `3` keys on the keyboard.

## Credits

The Visualizer was created in Unity3D, and the Proxy is a normal C# application that is using the SharpDX library for capturing the USB controllers.
